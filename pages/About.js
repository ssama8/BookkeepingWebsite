			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p>
				In 1998 a stay at home Mom started a bookkeeping business. She began
				with one client and provided personal treatment and exceptional customer
				service. This caused her business to grow over the next several years
				solely by word of mouth. Ten years later she had more than twenty-five
				clients and not enough time in a day. Her husband got more involved in
				the business, employees were retained, and the business name was changed
				to TOMAndSON Bookkeeping. Now several years later, our mission is still
				the same, treat our clients as partners looking out for their best
				interests while providing a much needed service. We hope that if you are
				in need of bookkeeping services that you would consider choosing
				TOMAndSON to take care of your accounting needs.
